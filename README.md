## From Developers 來自開發者的話

是甚麼樣的元素會讓你想起家呢？也許是那份溫暖，也許是空氣中飄散的淡淡塵味。又或許，是那熟悉的聲音喚醒你塵封已久的記憶。
 
Home, what makes you think of home? Perhaps the warmness, or maybe the scent? Or maybe, the sound reminds you of the precious happiness you’ve received.


在這次的發想中，我們專注在透過聲音回家的意義。我們的主角：海蒂，希望能夠找到回家的路：然而基於不明原因，路上有許多怪物擋住他的道路。為了引開這些敵人，海蒂必須先蒐集 "聲球"，也就是帶有代表回憶的聲音球。有了聲球後，使用聲球能夠把怪物引開，進而往家的方向繼續前進。為甚麼主角要回家呢? 這些聲音又代表著甚麼意義呢? 這些怪物阻擋你的理由又是甚麼呢? 這些原因，隨著遊戲的進行，玩家會漸漸地了解整個故事，以及找到了解回家的真正意義。

We focus the meaning of homecoming, with the sound guiding the path to your destination. We all agree the sound is one of the most important elements that brought back your memories. Our protagonist, Hade, trying to find his path home. However, the path isn’t easy. For certain reasons, there are creatures blocking his way. To distract the enemy, Hade must collect the Voice Orbs. The glowing ball with a voice representing a piece of his memories. Why are they antagonizing in his way? What does the voice mean? There is always a reason. We invited you to experience the story by playing the game, knowing the reason for coming home, and also, the true meaning of the homecoming path.


因為時間因素，聲音部分只有中文的版本。

Due to deadlines, the voices are only translated into Chinese.


希望你享受這款遊戲！

Hope you enjoy it!
